        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>I think that the ICT field suits me the best because I tend to remember the logic behind a piece of
            information, not the information itself. I have always been interested in mathematics and computers
            and I find programming quite an entertaining activity because you never come across the same problem. I
            believe coding keeps your mind constantly working.
        </p>
        <p>I think the gaming industry would be quite interesting for me. Since I started geometry, spatial geometry has
            caught my attention and I would like to be able to incorporate it into my future "programming career".
            In general, I would like to see my code coming to life in a real situation, maybe even
            creating/administrating sites for big companies. </p>
        <h3>Why gaming?</h3>
        <p>Because it is a very diverse and constantly growing industry. From the sudoku you play on your phone to pass
            th time to real games that require a full on schedule to keep on track with, games have been a part of our
            lives for years now,
            and the industry seems to be expanding exponentially. Also, working in the gaming industry gives you the
            opportunitys to explore new technologies, tools, techniques and ideas that could yield something entirely
            game-changing.
        </p>
        <p>Some sites that can explain and justify my opinion are <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/gaming-industry-a-lucrative-career-option/">TheTimesOfIndia</a> and <a href="https://builtin.com/gaming">BuiltIn</a>.</p>
        <p>As most teenegers on this planet, I love gaming. </p>
