        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>I think that the ICT field suits me the best because I tend to remember the logic behind a piece of
            information, not the information itself. I have always been interested in mathematics and computers
            and I find programming quite an entertaining activity because you never come across the same problem. I
            believe coding keeps your mind constantly working.
        </p>
        <p>I think the gaming industry would be quite interesting for me. Since I started geometry, spatial geometry has
            caught my attention and I would like to be able to incorporate it into my future "programming career".
            In general, I would like to see my code coming to life in a real situation, maybe even
            creating/administrating sites for big companies. </p>
        <h3>Why gaming?</h3>
        <p>Because it is a very diverse and constantly growing industry. From the sudoku you play on your phone to pass
            th time to real games that require a full on schedule to keep on track with, games have been a part of our
            lives for years now,
            and the industry seems to be expanding exponentially. Also, working in the gaming industry gives you the
            opportunitys to explore new technologies, tools, techniques and ideas that could yield something entirely
            game-changing.
        </p>
        <p>As most teenegers on this planet, I love gaming. Some of my favorite games are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>It Takes Two</i> - Needs 2 players, a really fun game to play with your best friend.</li>
            <li><i>Sims4</i> - The best way to create scenarios outside of your head. Alternative to playing with dolls,
                but for "adults".You can find out more about this game here</a>.</li>
            <li><i>Stardew Valley</i> - An indie game that reminds me of the "simple farm life". You can play alone or
                with friends.
            </li>
            <li><i>Don't Starve Together</i> -Quite an unknown game, but a good one. You can play with friends or online
                with strangers that might try to take your items. I think it's impossible to get through all the seasons
                without looking for hints online. Prove me wrong!</li>
            <li><i>Overcooked 2</i> -It can be played alone, but is far better with friends. Can be very addictive and
                might ruin some friendships.</li>
        </ul>
