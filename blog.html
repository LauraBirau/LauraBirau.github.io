        <h4>Study choice</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>What initiatives did you take to make your study choice?</summary>
            <p>I have read the brochure/site very carefully and also I have attended to a lot of information sessions
                about life at HZ and especially the ICT programme.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why did you choose this study programme?</summary>
            <p>m not quite good at memorizing, I tend to remember the logic behind the information I am given, so, when
                I discovered computer science/informatics, I thought it was just the subject for me. Now, searching for
                a programme that matches my interests, I found ICT, which involves, in my view, programming applied in
                real problems with real solutions.
                Applying the code I am writing to a real situation gives me the opportunity to taste the future work
                environment while I am still studying. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What do you want to do after graduating?</summary>
            <p>I think the gaming industry would be quite interesting for me. In general, I would like to see my code
                coming to life in a real situation, maybe even creating/administrating sites for big companies.
                During my studies, I expect to learn how to assess situation in a computer logic matter and to develop
                knowledge in more programming languages (right now I only know some general coding in C++).</p>
        </details>
        <h4>Personal SWOT analysis</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>What do you do best?</summary>
            <p>I am a logical and curious learner. This helps me accumulate a lot of information and have a systematic
                approach to any problem.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What personality traits may be holding you
                back in your studies / career?</summary>
            <p>d to take the responsibility/lead in all my projects. Therefore, people often take advantage of this and
                I always end up with a lot more work than my colleagues.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How can you turn your strengths /
                weaknesses into opportunities?</summary>
            <p>munication. I believe having leading abilities helps me organize a project and my logical thinking makes
                an order in the tasks.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What obstacles do you face to succeed as a
                student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from
                succeeding in your studies / career?</summary>
            <p>I sometimes overthink and underestimate my abilities. But I believe this works well with my tendency to
                continuously test my powers. </p>
        </details>
        <h4>Programming experience</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>What kind of experience did you had?</summary>
            <p>I have studied C++ in high school and I believe I have developed a sufficient understanding regarding
                programming logic in basic mathematics. I have worked with vectors, matrices and strings and I also one
                of my final exams is going to test my abilities. Also, in my final year, I have learned some basics in
                MySQL, HTML, PHP and CSS.</p>
